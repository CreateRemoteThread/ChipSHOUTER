# ChipSHOUTER速
ChipSHOUTER速 - The Electromagnetic Fault Injection (EMFI) Platform By NewAE Technology Inc. This repo is used to hold the Python API, examples, and other useful information. 

## Open-Source and Associated Tools

The full ChipSHOUTER is not OSHW, there are several repositories containing useful open-source tools that can be used with ChipSHOUTER and other EMFI platforms. These include:

* Ballistic Gel: a SRAM-based calibration board that can be used to measure the impact of EM (or other) fault injection. This is especially useful when comparing probe tip types.

* Simple EMFI Target: A very simple EMFI target, useful for quickly confirming an EMFI system is working. As it's completely stand-alone there is little risk of damaging connected devices, if you are trying things like spark-gap EMFI using a BBQ lighter.

* ChipSHOVER is a XY(Z) table and controller. Note controller for this has fully open-source firmware, allowing you to develop unique extensions to the platform (nb: not yet released).

## Documentation

## What makes ChipSHOUTER速 Awesome

ChipSHOUTER not only reduces the cost of EMFI research, it packages a complete learning environment. We include not only the injection tool, but different tips and target devices to help you understand the effects of EMFI.
